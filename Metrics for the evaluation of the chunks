To evaluate the performance of the chunking strategy we can you certain metrices such as relevancy, correctness, token efficiency, cost. 
let us take an example for each of these metrics 

##Relevancy
objective --> finding out whether the chunks are relevant to user queries 
example --> for the query "how can i group dataframe in pandas" , "chunk x is relevant as it discuss about grouping dataframe"

##Correctness 
objective --> verification of the chunk text and context preservation with the original transcript
example --> check if chunk x accurately shows the content of original transcript 

##Token efficiency
objective --> understanding the efficiency of the chunk sizes.
example --> calculate the average length of chunks and ensure they fall within a predefined range

##Cost
Objective --> estimating the processing and the storage cost
example --> calculate the total token count and estimate processing cost as per standard norms

there can be several other metrices too that can help to imporve better that can be learnt by understanding various other factors.
